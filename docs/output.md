The `MirMachine` main executable will generate GFF annotations (filtered and unfiltered) and some other files.
You will see `results/predictions/` directory which contains:

`gff/` __All predicted miRNA families.__  
`filtered_gff/` __High confidence miRNA family predictions after bitscore filtering. (This file is what you need in most cases)__  
`fasta/` __Both high and low confidence predictions in FASTA format.__
